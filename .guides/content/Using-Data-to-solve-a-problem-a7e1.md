### Challenge: Buying A Car: 
|||

Create a real-world data set that can be used in our Car Buying Activity.  Each data item in your table should have atleast four choices, but you may have up to ten different options to choose from.  Create this table using Spreadsheet software such as MS Excel and submit to your teacher. 
(Example: Car Make: Ford OR Chevrolet)

Later, we will use the data that you create, to compare the two choices of cars that you have selected. 

### EXAMPLE:
