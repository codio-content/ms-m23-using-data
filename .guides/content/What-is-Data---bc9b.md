**Data** is defined as facts or figures, or information that's stored in or used by a computer. An example of data is information collected for a research paper.

It could be a collection of numbers, letters, dates, images or sound.  For example, your height, age, shoe size, hair color, gender, etc.. is a collection of data about you. 

This data can be used in many different ways to provide information about you. This is what makes data useful, when it can be transformed into information.
