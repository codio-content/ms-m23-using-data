Data and instructions are **processed** by the Central Processing Unit(CPU). 

The CPU is the computer system's **brain** that can transform data from input devices into useful information or a physical action. 

The CPU can process data really fast, but it can not think for itself.  It only does what it is told to do by following instructions. These instructions are programmed into the computer by programmers like you.
