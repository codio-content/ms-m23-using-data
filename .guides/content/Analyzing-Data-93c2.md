Data becomes information when it is put into context, or given meaning.  A barcode number is just data on it's own. So is the product name, image and price. 

However, this collection of data becomes useful information when the data is **analyzed**, or put together in a meaningful format. 

When a barcode is scanned, we can find out what the item is, what it looks like and how much it will cost. 

This is useful information that can be processed.
